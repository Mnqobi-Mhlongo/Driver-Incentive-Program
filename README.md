## About

The Driver Commission Optimizer is designed for a car companyâ€™s driver incentive program, allowing drivers to maximize their monthly commission by optimizing trip schedules. Each driver earns R10 per passenger, and this program calculates:

1. The maximum number of passengers a driver can carry over the month.
2. The maximum commission based on the optimal passenger count.
3. The sequence of cars that should be driven to achieve this commission.

## Program Features

- **Optimal Trip Scheduling**: Uses dynamic programming to find the best sequence of trips for maximizing passengers.
- **Commission Calculation**: Computes the daily and monthly commission based on passenger count.
- **Output to File**: Results are written to an `output.txt` file, detailing passengers carried, cars used, and commission earned.
